### Get It Right Now

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

All you have to do is

1. Click **Deploy to Heroku**
2. Fill in the **Environment Variables** when prompted. These will be a *[Github Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens)*, which should have Organization privileges enabled, and a *GitHub Organization name*, and a *background color*. The choices are `{blue,green,grey,pink,red,white}`. If you don't enter one of those strings, it defaults to 'white'. Lastly an optional *GitHub Organization team* can also be specified if you want your users to auto-join a default team.

#### All Done! Just share the Heroku App's URL to people, and they'll be able to get themselves an invitation to your organization.
